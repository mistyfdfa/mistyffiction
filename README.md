# MistyFFiction.com Repo

Hey there! You have landed in my back-up repository for all the coding I have done to my WP-based website, <a href="https://mistyffiction.com">MistyFFiction.com</a>. I will work on breaking out the fucntionalities that I have developed in the future but, for now, this is mostly just another place to store the code so I have a fallback if something goes horribly wrong (which it will, eventually).

### Wordpress Plug-In Development

core.php - Changes I have made to core functionality of Wordpress <br />
formatting.php - Formatting tools and shortcodes to display information saved in custom_fields <br />
<a href="https://github.com/mistyfdfa/mistyffiction/blob/master/post_revision_tools.php">post_revision_tools</a> - For working with revisions so that I am not duplicating pages for rough drafts and their revisions. <br /> 

### Wordpress Theme Development

style.css - style sheet for mistyffiction.com <br />
functions.php - updates for <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes">-child theme</a> functionality <br />
